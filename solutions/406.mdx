You are given an array of `people`, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>] represents the i<sup>th</sup> person of height h<sub>i</sub> with <b>exactly</b> k<sub>i</sub> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h<sub>i</sub>.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>] is the attributes of the j<sup>th</sup> person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
- 0 <= h<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>6</sup>
- 0 <= k<sub>i</sub> < people.length
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

```ts title=solution.ts
function reconstructQueue(people: number[][]): number[][] {
  let res = [];
  people.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a[0] == b[0]) {
      return a[1] - b[1];
    }
    return b[0] - a[0];
  });
  people.forEach((val) => {
    res.splice(val[1], 0, val);
  });
  return res;
}
```
