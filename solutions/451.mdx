Given a string `s`, sort it in <b>decreasing order</b> based on the <b>frequency</b> of the characters. The <b>frequency</b> of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

<b>Example 3:</b>

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 \* 10<sup>5</sup>
- s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

```ts title=solution.ts
function frequencySort(s: string): string {
  let seen = {};
  let result = "";
  for (const char of s) {
    if (seen[char]) {
      seen[char]++;
    } else {
      seen[char] = 1;
    }
  }
  let sortedCharacterArray = Object.keys(seen).sort((a, b) => {
    return seen[b] - seen[a];
  });
  for (let char of sortedCharacterArray) {
    result += char.repeat(seen[char]);
  }
  return result;
}
```
