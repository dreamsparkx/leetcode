You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

1 <= bad <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

```ts title=solution.ts
/**
 * The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
 * isBadVersion(version: number): boolean {
 *     ...
 * };
 */

var solution = function (isBadVersion: any) {
  return function (n: number): number {
    let left = 1,
      right = n;
    while (right > left) {
      const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
      if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    return left;
  };
};
```
