You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `'-'`.
- 1 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup>

```ts title=solution.ts
function licenseKeyFormatting(s: string, k: number): string {
  const newStr = s.replace(/-/g, "").toUpperCase(); // Remove existing dashes and convert any lowercase letters to uppercase
  const arr = newStr.split(""); // Convert string to an array so we can manipulate it
  for (let i = arr.length - 1 - k; i >= 0; i -= k) {
    // Loop through array backwards and decrement by value of K
    arr[i] = arr[i] + "-";
  }
  return arr.join("");
}
```
