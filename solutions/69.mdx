Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are <b>truncated</b>, and only <b>the integer part</b> of the result is returned.

<b>Note:</b> You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator,
such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or x `** 0.5`.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

<b>Remember that the square root of each X must happen within [1, x/2 + 1]</b>

```ts title=solution.ts
function mySqrt(x: number): number {
  let left = 1,
    right = Math.floor(x / 2) + 1;
  let mid;
  while (left <= right) {
    mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (mid * mid > x) {
      right = mid - 1;
    } else if (mid * mid < x) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return right;
}
```
