We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).
  Return the number that I picked.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

<b>Example 3:</b>

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
- `1 <= pick <= n`

/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param {number} num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number

function guessNumber(n: number): number {
  let l = 0;
  let r = n - 1;
  while (l <= r) {
    let mid = Math.floor((l + r) / 2);
    let res = guess(mid);
    if (res === 0) return mid;
    else if (res == 1) l = mid + 1;
    else r = mid - 1;
  }
  return l;
}
```
