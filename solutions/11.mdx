You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

<b>Notice</b> that you may not slant the container.

<br />

<b>Example 1:</b>
<br />

<img src={imageURL} width="483" height="342" />

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

```ts title=solution.ts
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
  let result = 0,
    left = 0,
    right = height.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let smallestSide = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    let area = (right - left) * smallestSide;
    if (area > result) {
      result = area;
    }
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
