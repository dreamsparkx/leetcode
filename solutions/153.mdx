Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is <b>rotated</b> between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.
  Notice that <b>rotating</b> an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of <b>unique</b> elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

<b>Example 3:</b>

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are <b>unique</b>.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

```ts title=solution.ts
function findMin(nums: number[]): number {
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid;
    }
  }
  return nums[left];
}
```
