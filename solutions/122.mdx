You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold <b>at most one</b> share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the <b>same day</b>.

Find and return the <b>maximum</b> profit you can achieve.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

<b>Example 3:</b>

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

```ts title=solution.ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  // Start with nothing and take every profitable opportunity from time travel
  let profit = 0;
  // Start from the second day (because that is the first day you could sell)
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    // We should go back 1 day and that is all we need
    const [priceYesterDay, priceToday] = [prices[i - 1], prices[i]];
    // Whenever there is profit, add
    if (priceYesterDay < priceToday) {
      profit += priceToday - priceYesterDay;
    }
    // Buy yesterday, sell today
  }
  return profit;
}
```
