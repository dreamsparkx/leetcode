Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

```ts title=solution.ts
function reverseString(s: string[]): void {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let temp = s[left];
    s[left] = s[right];
    s[right] = temp;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
}
```
