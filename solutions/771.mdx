You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

<b>Example 1:</b>

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

```ts title=solution.ts
function numJewelsInStones(jewels: string, stones: string): number {
  const jewelSet = new Set(jewels);
  return stones
    .split("")
    .reduce((res, s) => ((res as any) + jewelSet.has(s)) as any, 0);
}
```
